## What is Anonsurf?

Anonsurf is one of the good anonymizing tools of Linux distribution. It helps us make our network tunnel secure. This tool uses TOR iptables to anonymize our network system. Anonsurf is a tool that will help you stay anonymous by routing every packet through TOR relay. When you use Anonsurf for ethical hacking, all the traffic from your system goes through a TOR proxy server due to which your IP address is changed.
